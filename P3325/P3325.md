Introduction
============

Execution environments are a fundamental part of the `std::execution` proposal,
[@P2300R9], but that paper provides no utility for creating or manipulating
environments. Such utilities are increasingly necessary considering that some
proposed APIs (e.g., `write_env` from [@P3284R0]) require passing an environment.

This paper proposes two simple utilities for creating execution environments:
one to create an environment out of a query/value pair and another to join
several environments into one.

Executive Summary
=================

This paper proposes the following changes to P2300R9:

* Add a class template provisionally called `prop` to the `std::execution`
  namespace. `prop` associates a query `Q` with a value `V`, yielding a
  *`queryable`* object `E` such that `E.query(Q)` is equal to `V`.

* Add a class template provisionally called `env` to the `std::execution`
  namespace. `env` aggregates several environments into one, giving precedence
  to the environments in lexical order.

* Optionally, replace `empty_env` with `env<>`.

Discussion
==========

Motivation
----------

In [@P2300R9], execution environments are an internal implementation detail of
the sender algorithms. There are no public-facing APIs that accept environment
objects as a parameter. One may wonder why a utility for constructing
environments is even necessary.

There are several reasons why the Standard Library would benefit from a utility
to construct an environment:

1. The set of sender algorithms is openly extensible. For those who decide to
    implement their own sender algorithms, the manipulation of execution
    environments is part of the job. Standard utilities will make this easier.

2. [@P3284R0] proposes a `write_env` sender adaptor that merges a user-specified
    environment with the environment of the receiver to which the sender is
    eventually connected. Using this adaptor requires the user to construct an
    environment. Although implementing an environment is not hard, an
    out-of-the-box solution will make using `write_env` simpler.

3. [@P3149R3] proposes two new algorithms, `spawn` and `spawn_future`, both of
    which can be parameterized by passing an environment as an optional
    argument.

4. Currently, there is no way to parameterize algorithms like `sync_wait` and
    `start_detached`. The author intends to bring a paper proposing overloads of
    those functions that accept environments as a way to inject things like stop
    tokens, allocators, and schedulers into the asynchronous operations that
    those algorithms launch.

In short, environments are how users will inject dependencies into async
computations. We can expect to see more APIs that will require (or will
optionally allow) the user to pass an environment. Thus, a standard utility for
making environments is desirable.

Design Considerations
---------------------

### Singleton Environments

Now that `tag_invoke` has been removed from P2300, defining an execution
environment is quite simple. To build an environment with a single query/value
pair, the following suffices:

```c++
template <class Query, class Value>
struct prop
{
  [[no_unique_address]] Query query_;
  Value value_;

  auto query(Query) const noexcept -> const Value &
  {
    return value_;
  }
};

// Example usage:
constexpr auto my_env = prop(get_allocator, std::allocator{});
```

Although simple, this template has some nice properties:

1. It is an aggregate so that members can be direct initialized from
    temporaries without so much as a move. A function that constructs and
    returns an environment using `prop` will benefit from RVO:

    ```c++
    // The frobnicator object will be constructed directly in
    // the callers stack frame:
    return prop(get_frobnicator, make_a_frobnicator());
    ```

2. An object constructed like `prop(get_allocator, my_allocator{})` will
    have the simple and unsurprising type
    `prop<get_allocator_t, my_allocator>`.

The `prop` utility proposed in this paper is only slightly more elaborate than
the `prop` class template shown above, and it shares these properties.

### Environment Composition

What if you need to construct an environment with more than one query/value
pair, say, an allocator and a scheduler? A utility to join multiple environments
would work together with `prop` to make a general environment-building utility.
This paper calls that utility `env`.

The following code demonstrates:

```c++
template <class Env, class Query>
concept @_`has-query`_@ = requires (const Env& env) { env.query(Query()); };

template <class... Envs>
struct env : Envs...
{
  template <class Query>
  static constexpr size_t _index_of() {
    constexpr bool flags[] = {@_`has-query`_@<Envs, Query>...};
    return ranges::find(flags, true) - flags;
  }

  template <class Query>
    requires (@_`has-query`_@<Envs, Query> ||...)
  decltype(auto) query(Query q) const noexcept(...)
  {
    auto tup = tie(static_cast<const Envs&>(*this)...);
    return get<_index_of<Query>()>(tup).query(q);
  }
};

template <class... Envs>
env(Envs...) -> env<Envs...>;

// Example usage:
constexpr auto my_env = env(prop(get_allocator, my_alloc{}),
                            prop(get_scheduler, my_sched{}));
```

This `env` class template shares the desirable properties of `prop`: aggregate
initialization and unsprising naming. A query is handled by the "leftmost" child
environment that can handle it.

Note that the above code has the issue that two child environments cannot have
the same type. That is not a limitation of the facility proposed below.

### By Value vs. By Reference

There are times when you would like an environment to respond to a query with a
reference to a particular object rather than a copy. Capturing a reference is
dangerous, so the opt-in to reference semantics should be explicit.

`std::reference_wrapper` is how the Standard Library deals with such
problems. It should be possible to construct an environment using
`std::ref` to specify that the "value" should be stored by reference:

```c++
std::mutex mtx;
const auto my_env = prop(get_mutex, std::ref(mtx));
std::mutex & ref = get_mutex(my_env);
assert(&ref == &mtx);
```

Similarly, there are times when you would like to store the child environment by
reference. `std::ref` should work for that case as well:

```c++
// At namespace scope, construct a reusable environment:
constexpr auto global_env = prop(get_frobnicator, make_frobnicator());

// Construct an environment with a particular value for the get_allocator
// query, and a reference to the constexpr global_env:
auto env_with_allocator(auto alloc)
{
  return env{prop(get_allocator, alloc), std::ref(global_env)};
}
```

The utility proposed in this paper satisfies all of the above use cases.

### Should Environments Be Constrained?

An interesting question came up during LEWG design review at the St. Louis
committee meeting. Consider a _`queryable`_ object `e` such that
`e.query(get_scheduler)` is well-formed. The `get_scheduler` query should always
return an object whose type satisfies the `scheduler` concept. So, should the
expression `e.query(get_scheduler)` be somehow constrained with that
requirement? Should the expression be ill-formed if it returns an `int`, say.

More to the point, should `prop(get_scheduler, 42)` even compile?

I believe the answer is yes, `prop(get_scheduler, 42).query(get_scheduler)`
should compile and run and return `42`. Environments are simple key/value
stores. They impose no syntactic or semantic constraints on the keys or the
values.

Rather, it is the responsibility of the _query_ object to enforce those
constraints. Recall that the way to query an environment is to pass it to a
query object, like so: `get_scheduler(e)`. I expect `get_scheduler` to be
implemented along these lines:

```c++
struct get_scheduler_t
{
  template <class Env>
    requires @_`has-query`_@<Env, get_scheduler_t>
  decltype(auto) operator()(const Env& env) const
  {

    // Mandates: env.query(*this) returns a scheduler
    static_assert(
      scheduler<decltype(env.query(*this))>,
      "The 'get_scheduler' query must return a type that satisfies the 'scheduler' concept.");

    return env.query(*this);
  }
}

inline constexpr get_scheduler_t get_scheduler {};
```

With the code above, the expression `get_scheduler(prop(get_scheduler, 42))`
makes the program ill-formed. We could chose to make it a _Requires:_ instead of
a _Mandates:_ but it doesn't change the design of `prop` or `env`. The point is
that each query object is responsible for checking its own requirements. It's
not the job of `prop` or `env`.

Naming
------

For the `prop` utility, a couple of other plausible names come to mind:

- `attr`
- `with`
- `property`
- `key_value`
- `query_value`

Other possibile names for `env` are:

- `attributes`, or `attrs`
- `properties`, or `props`
- `dictionary`, or `dict`

Implementation Experience
=========================

Types with a very similar designs have seen heavy use in `stdexec` for over two
years. The design proposed below has been prototyped and can be found
on [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/976b1G45a)[^1].

*A note on implementability:* The implementation of `env` is simple if we only
want to support braced list initialization with class template argument
deduction, like `env{e1, e2, e2}`. Initialization from a parenthesized
expression list with CTAD for an arbitrary number of arguments (e.g., `env(e1,
e2, e3, ...)`) is not implementable in standard C++ to the author's knowledge.

In the proposed wording, `env` is specified such that it will be able to benefit
from member packs ([@P3115R0]) if and when they become available or should
aggregate initialization with a parenthesized expression list ever be extended
to support brace elision for subobjects.

Future Extensions
=================

There are several ways this utility might be extended in the future:

- Add a way to _remove_ a query from an environment.
- Add a wrapper for a reference to an environment.
- Add a wrapper that only accepts queries that are _forwarding_ (see
  [[exec.fwd.env]](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2300r9.html#spec-execution.forwarding_query)).

I would like to thank Lewis Baker for many enlightening conversations about the
design of execution environments. The design presented here owes much to Lewis's
insights.
