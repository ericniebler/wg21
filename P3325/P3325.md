Introduction
============

Execution environments are a fundamental part of the `std::execution` proposal,
[@P2300R9], but that paper provides no utility for creating or manipulating
environments. Such utilities are increasingly necessary considering that some
proposed APIs (e.g., `write_env` from [@P3284R0]) require passing an environment.

This paper proposes a simple utility for creating an execution environment out
of whole cloth. Later papers will expand on this functionality.

Executive Summary
=================

This paper proposes the addition of a class template provisionally called `env`
to the `std::execution` namespace. `env` associates a query `Q` with a value
`V`, yielding a *`queryable`* object `E` such that `Q(E)` is equal to `V`.

Discussion
==========

Motivation
----------

In [@P2300R9], execution environments are an internal implementation detail of
the sender algorithms. There are no public-facing APIs that accept environment
objects as a parameter. One may wonder why a utility for constructing
environments is even necessary.

There are several reasons why the Standard Library would benefit from a utility
to construct an environment:

1. The set of sender algorithms is openly extensible. For those who decide to
    implement their own sender algorithms, the manipulation of execution
    environments is part of the job. Standard utilities will make this easier.

2. [@P3284R0] proposes a `write_env` sender adaptor that merges a user-specified
    environment with the environment of the receiver to which the sender is
    eventually connected. Using this adaptor requires the user to construct an
    environment. Although implementing an environment is not hard, an
    out-of-the-box solution will make using `write_env` simpler.

3. [@P3149R3] proposes two new algorithms, `spawn` and `spawn_future`, both of
    which can be parameterized by passing an environment as an optional
    argument.

4. Currently, there is no way to parameterize algorithms like `sync_wait` and
    `start_detached`. The author intends to bring a paper proposing overloads of
    those functions that accept environments as a way to inject things like stop
    tokens, allocators, and schedulers into the asynchronous operations that
    those algorithms launch.

In short, environments are how users will inject dependencies into async
computations. We can expect to see more APIs that will require (or will
optionally allow) the user to pass an environment. Thus, a standard utility for
making environments is desirable. 

Design Considerations
---------------------

### Singleton Environments

Now that `tag_invoke` has been removed from P2300, defining an execution
environment is quite simple. To build an environment with a single query/value
pair, the following suffices:

```c++
template <class Query, class Value>
struct env
{
  [[no_unique_address]] Query query_;
  Value value_;

  auto query(Query) const noexcept -> const Value &
  {
    return value_;
  }
};

// Example usage:
constexpr auto my_env = env(get_allocator, std::allocator{});
```

Although simple, this template has some nice properties:

1. It is an aggregate so that members can be direct initialized from
    temporaries without so much as a move. A function that constructs and
    returns an environment using `env` will benefit from RVO:

    ```c++
    // The frobnicator object will be constructed directly in
    // the callers stack frame:
    return env(get_frobnicator, make_a_frobnicator());
    ```

2. An object constructed like `env(get_allocator, my_allocator{})` will
    have the simple and unsurprising type
    `env<get_allocator_t, my_allocator>`.

The utility proposed in this paper is only slightly more elaborate than
the `env` class template shown above, and it shares these properties.

### Environment Composition

What if you need to construct an environment with more than one key/value
pair, say, an allocator and a scheduler? The `env` utility can be extended
to accept an optional "child" environment to which it would dispatch all
unknown queries.

The following code demonstrates:

```c++
template <class Query, class Value, class ChildEnv = empty_env>
struct env
{
  [[no_unique_address]] Query query_;
  Value value_;
  ChildEnv child_;

  auto query(auto q) const noexcept(...) -> decltype(child_.query(q))
  {
    return child_.query(q);
  }

  auto query(Query) const noexcept -> const Value &
  {
    return value_;
  }
};

// Example usage:
constexpr auto my_env = env(get_allocator, my_alloc{}, env(get_scheduler, my_sched{}));
```

This `env` class template retains the desirable properties of the original
while adding the ability to nest environments. Queries will be handled
by the "parent" environment if possible, and by the "child" environment
otherwise.

### By Value vs. By Reference

There are times when you would like an environment to respond to a query with a
reference to a particular object rather than a copy. Capturing a reference is
dangerous, so the opt-in to reference semantics should be explicit.

`std::reference_wrapper` is how the Standard Library deals with such
problems. It should be possible to construct an environment using
`std::ref` to specify that the "value" should be stored by reference:

```c++
std::mutex mtx;
const auto my_env = env(get_mutex, std::ref(mtx));
std::mutex & ref = get_mutex(my_env);
assert(&ref == &mtx);
```

Similarly, there are times when you would like to store the child environment by
reference. `std::ref` should work for that case as well:

```c++
// At namespace scope, construct a reusable environment:
constexpr auto global_env = env(get_frobnicator, make_frobnicator());

// Construct an environment with a particular value for the get_allocator
// query, and a reference to the constexpr global_env:
auto env_with_allocator(auto alloc)
{
  return env(get_allocator, alloc, std::ref(global_env));
}
```

The utility proposed in this paper satisfies all of the above use cases.

Naming
------

The author thinks `env` is the least surprising name for this utility.
Other possibilities considered are:

- `with`
- `environment`
- `key_value`
- `property` or `properties`
- `dictionary` or `dict`


Implementation Experience
=========================

A type with a very similar design has seen heavy use in `stdexec` for over two
years. The design proposed below has been prototyped and can be found
on [godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org/z/Yq5MTPac8)[^1].

Future Extensions
=================

There are several ways this utility might be extended in the future:

- Add a way to join two environments.
- Add a way to _remove_ a query from an environment.
- Add a wrapper for a reference to an environment.
- Add a wrapper that only accepts queries that are _forwarding_ (see
  [[exec.fwd.env]](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2300r9.html#spec-execution.forwarding_query)).

I would like to thank Lewis Baker for many enlightening conversations about the
design of execution environments. The design presented here owes much to Lewis's
insights.
