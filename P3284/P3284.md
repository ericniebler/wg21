Introduction
============

This paper proposes to add two new sender adaptor algorithms to the
`std::execution` namespace, targetting C++26: `write_env` and
`unstoppable`. These adaptors were originally proposed as part of [@P3175R3] but
were split out into their own paper so that the higher priority items in
P3175 could advance more quickly.

Executive Summary
=================

Below are the specific changes this paper proposes:

1. Add a new uncustomizable adaptor `write_env` for writing values into the
    receiver's execution environment. Use `write_env` in the implementation of
    the `on` algorithm and to simplify the specification of the `let_`
    algorithms.

2. Add an uncustomizable `unstoppable` adaptor that is a trivial application of
    `write_env`: it sets the current stop token in the receiver's environment to
    a `never_stop_token`.

Description
===========

[@P3175R3] proposed some changes to the `std::execution::on` algorithm, the
specification of which was made simpler by the addition of some additional
adaptors. Those adaptors were general and useful in their own right, so P3175R3
suggested they be added to `std::execution` proper. The conservative approach
was to make them exposition-only, and that is how things currently stand in the
working draft.

The author still feels like those adaptors are worthy of standardization. This
paper proposes adding them.

The adaptors in question are as follows:

`write_env`
-----------

A receiver has an associated "execution environment", which is an unstructured,
queryable key/value store. It is used to pass implicit parameters from parent
operations to their children. It is occasionally useful for a sender adaptor to
explicitly mutate the key/value store so that child operations see different
values for environment queries. The `write_env` sender adaptor is used for that 
purpose.

`write_env` is a customization point object, although it is not actually
customizable. It accepts a sender `sndr` and an execution environment `env`, and
it returns a new sender that stores `sndr` and `env`. When that sender is
connected to a receiver `rcvr`, it returns the result of connecting `sndr` with
a receiver that adapts `rcvr`. The environment of that adapted receiver is the
result of joining `env` with `rcvr`'s environment. The two environments are
joined such that, when the joined environment is queried, `env` is queried
first, and if `env` doesn't have a value for that query, the result of
`get_env(rcvr)` is queried.

### Example: `write_env`

One example of where `write_env` might be useful is to specify an allocator
to be used by child operations. The code might look like this:

```c++
// Turn a query object and a value into a queryable environment
// (see [@P3325R2]):
template <class Query, class Value>
struct prop {
  Query query;
  Value value;
  decltype(auto) query(Query) const noexcept { return (value); }
};

// Adapts a sender so that it can use the given allocator:
struct with_allocator_t {
  template <std::execution::sender Sndr, class Alloc>
  auto operator()(Sndr sndr, Alloc alloc) const {
    return std::execution::write_env(sndr, prop(std::get_allocator, alloc));
  }

  template <class Alloc>
  auto operator()(Alloc alloc) const {
    return std::execution::write_env(prop(std::get_allocator, alloc));
  }
};

constexpr with_allocator_t with_allocator{};
```

The `with_allocator` adaptor might be used to parameterize senders
produced by a third-party library as follows:

```c++
namespace ex = std::execution;

// This returns a sender that does some piece of asynchronous work
// created by a third-party library, but parameterized with a custom
// allocator.
ex::sender auto make_async_work_with_alloc() {
  ex::sender auto work = third_party::make_async_work();

  return with_allocator(std::move(work), custom_allocator());
}
```

The sender returned by `third_party::make_async_work` might query for
the allocator and use it to do allocations:

```c++
namespace third_party {
  namespace ex = std::execution;

  // A function that returns a sender that generates data on a special
  // execution context, populate a std::vector with it, and then completes
  // by sending the vector.
  constexpr auto _populate_data_vector = 
    []<class Allocator>(Allocator alloc) {
      // Create an empty vector of ints that uses a specified allocator.
      using IntAlloc = std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::template rebind_alloc<int>;
      auto data = std::vector<int, IntAlloc>{IntAlloc{std::move(alloc)}};

      // Create some work that generates data and fills in the vector.
      auto work = ex::just(std::move(data))
        | ex::then([](auto data) {
            // Generate the data and fill in the vector:
            data.append_range(third_party::make_data())
            return data;
          });

      // Execute the work on a special third_party execution context:
      // (This uses the `on` as specified in P3175.)
      return ex::on(third_party_scheduler(), std::move(work));
    };

  // A function that returns the sender produced by `_populate_data_vector`,
  // parameterized by an allocator read out of the receiver's environment.
  ex::sender auto make_async_work() {
    return ex::let_value(
      // This reads the allocator out of the receiver's execution environment.
      ex::read_env(std::get_allocator),
      _populate_data_vector
    );
  }
}
```

`unstoppable`
-------------

The `unstoppable` sender adaptor is a trivial application of `write_env`
that modifies a sender so that it no longer responds to external stop
requests. That can be of critical importance when the successful completion
of a sender is necessary to ensure program correctness, *e.g.*, to restore an
invariant.

The `unstoppable` adaptor might be implemented as follows:

```c++
inline constexpr struct @*unstoppable-t*@ {
  template <sender Sndr>
  auto operator()(Sndr sndr) const {
    return write_env(std::move(sndr), prop(std::get_stop_token, never_stop_token()));
  }

  auto operator()() const {
    return write_env(prop(std::get_stop_token, never_stop_token()));
  }
} unstoppable {};
```


### Example: `unstoppable`

In the following example, some asynchronous work must temporarily break a
program invariant. It uses `unstoppable` and a hypothetical `finally` algorithm
to restore the invariant. `finally` runs a predecessor sender, saves its
results, runs another sender, and then propagates saved results of the
predecessor.

```c++
  namespace ex = std::execution;

  ex::sender auto break_invariants(auto&... values);
  ex::sender auto restore_invariants(auto&... values);

  // This function returns a sender adaptor closure object. When applied to
  // a sender, it returns a new sender that breaks program invariants,
  // munges the data, and restores the invariants.
  auto safely_munge_data( ) {
    return ex::let_value( [](auto&... values) {
        return break_invariants(values...)
          | ex::then(do_munge) // the invariants will be restored even if `do_munge` throws
          | finally(ex::unstoppable(restore_invariants(values...)));
    } );
  }

  auto sndr = ...;
  spawn( sndr | safely_munge_data(), scope_token ); // See `counting_scope` from P3149R6
```
