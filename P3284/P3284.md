Introduction
============

This paper proposes to add three new sender adaptor algorithms to the
`std::execution` namespace, targetting C++26: `finally`, `write_env`, and
`unstoppable`. These adaptors were originally proposed as part of [@P3175R0] but
have been split out into their own paper so that the higher priority items in
P3175 can advance more quickly.

Executive Summary
=================

Below are the specific changes this paper proposes:

1. Add a new uncustomizable adaptor `write_env` for writing values into the
    receiver's execution environment. Use `write_env` in the implementation of
    the `on` algorithm and to simplify the specification of the `let_`
    algorithms.

2. Add an uncustomizable `unstoppable` adaptor that is a trivial application of
    `write_env`: it sets the current stop token in the receiver's environment to
    a `never_stop_token`. `unstoppable` is used in the re-specification of the
    `schedule_from` algorithm.

3. Generalize the specification for `schedule_from` to take two senders instead
    of a sender and a scheduler, name it `finally`, and make it uncustomizable.
    Specify the default implementation of `schedule_from(sch, snd)` as
    `finally(snd, unstoppable(schedule(sch)))`.


Description
===========

[@P3175R0] proposed some changes to the `std::execution::on` algorithm, the
specification of which was made simpler by the addition of some additional
adaptors. Those adaptors were general and useful in their own right, so P3175R0
suggested they be added to `std::execution` proper. The conservative approach
was to make them exposition-only, and that is how things currently stand in the
working draft.

The author still feels like those adaptors are worthy of standardization. This
paper proposes adding them.

The adaptors in question are as follows:

`write_env`
-----------

A receiver has an associated "execution environment", which is an unstructured,
queryable key/value store. It is used to pass implicit parameters from parent
operations to their children. It is occasionally useful for a sender adaptor to
explicitly mutate the key/value store so that child operations see different
values for environment queries. The `write_env` sender adaptor is used for that 
purpose.

`write_env` is a customization point object, although it is not actually
customizable. It accepts a sender `sndr` and an execution environment `env`, and
it returns a new sender that stores `sndr` and `env`. When that sender is
connected to a receiver `rcvr`, it returns the result of connecting `sndr` with
a receiver that adapts `rcvr`. The environment of that adapted receiver is the
result of joining `env` with `rcvr`'s environment. The two environments are
joined such that, when the joined environment is queried, `env` is queried
first, and if `env` doesn't have a value for that query, the result of
`get_env(rcvr)` is queried.

### Example: `write_env`

One example of where `write_env` might be useful is to specify an allocator
to be used by child operations. The code might look like this:

```c++
// Turn a query object and a value into a queryable environment
// (see [@P3325R2]):
template <class Query, class Value>
struct prop {
  Query query;
  Value value;
  decltype(auto) query(Query) const noexcept { return (value); }
};

// Adapts a sender so that it can use the given allocator:
struct with_allocator_t {
  template <std::execution::sender Sndr, class Alloc>
  auto operator()(Sndr sndr, Alloc alloc) const {
    return std::execution::write_env(sndr, prop(std::get_allocator, alloc));
  }

  template <class Alloc>
  auto operator()(Alloc alloc) const {
    return std::execution::write_env(prop(std::get_allocator, alloc));
  }
};

constexpr with_allocator_t with_allocator{};
```

The `with_allocator` adaptor might be used to parameterize senders
produced by a third-party library as follows:

```c++
namespace ex = std::execution;

// This returns a sender that does some piece of asynchronous work
// created by a third-party library, but parameterized with a custom
// allocator.
ex::sender auto make_async_work_with_alloc() {
  ex::sender auto work = third_party::make_async_work();

  return with_allocator(std::move(work), custom_allocator());
}
```

The sender returned by `third_party::make_async_work` might query for
the allocator and use it to do allocations:

```c++
namespace third_party {
  namespace ex = std::execution;

  // A function that returns a sender that generates data on a special
  // execution context, populate a std::vector with it, and then completes
  // by sending the vector.
  constexpr auto _populate_data_vector = 
    []<class Allocator>(Allocator alloc) {
      // Create an empty vector of ints that uses a specified allocator.
      using IntAlloc = std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::template rebind_alloc<int>;
      auto data = std::vector<int, IntAlloc>{IntAlloc{std::move(alloc)}};

      // Create some work that generates data and fills in the vector.
      auto work = ex::just(std::move(data))
        | ex::then([](auto data) {
            // Generate the data and fill in the vector:
            data.append_range(third_party::make_data())
            return data;
          });

      // Execute the work on a special third_party execution context:
      // (This uses the `on` as specified in P3175.)
      return ex::on(third_party_scheduler(), std::move(work));
    };

  // A function that returns the sender produced by `_populate_data_vector`,
  // parameterized by an allocator read out of the receiver's environment.
  ex::sender auto make_async_work() {
    return ex::let_value(
      // This reads the allocator out of the receiver's execution environment.
      ex::read_env(std::get_allocator),
      _populate_data_vector
    );
  }
}
```

`unstoppable`
-------------

The `unstoppable` sender adaptor is a trivial application of `write_env`
that modifies a sender so that it no longer responds to external stop
requests. That can be of critical importance when the successful completion
of a sender is necessary to ensure program correctness, *e.g.*, to restore an
invariant.

The `unstoppable` adaptor might be implemented as follows:

```c++
inline constexpr struct @*unstoppable-t*@ {
  template <sender Sndr>
  auto operator()(Sndr sndr) const {
    return write_env(std::move(sndr), prop(std::get_stop_token, never_stop_token()));
  }

  auto operator()() const {
    return write_env(prop(std::get_stop_token, never_stop_token()));
  }
} unstoppable {};
```

The section describing the `finally` adaptor will give a motivating example that
makes use of `unstoppable`.

`finally`
---------

The C++ language lacks direct support for asynchronous destruction; that is,
there is no way to say, "After this asynchronous operation, unconditionally run
another asynchronous operation, regardless of how the first one completes."
Without this capability, there is no native way to have "async RAII": the
pairing the asynchronous acquisition of a resource with its asynchronous
reclaimation.

The `finally` sender adaptor captures the "async RAII" pattern in the sender
domain. `finally` takes two senders. When connected and started, the `finally`
sender connects and starts the first sender. When that sender completes, it
saves the asynchronous result and then connects and starts the second sender. If
the second sender completes successfully, the results from the first sender are
propagated. Otherwise, the results from the second sender are propagated.

There is a sender in [exec] very much like `finally` as described above:
`schedule_from`. The only meaningful difference is that in `schedule_from`,
the "second sender" is always the result of calling `schedule` on a
scheduler. With `finally`, the default implementation of `schedule_from`
is trivial:

```c++
template <sender Sndr, scheduler Sched>
auto @*default-schedule-from-impl*@(Sndr sndr, Sched sched) {
  return finally(std::move(sndr), unstoppable(schedule(sched)));
}
```

This paper proposes repurposing the wording of `schedule_from` to specify
`finally`, and then specifying `schedule_from` in terms of `finally` and
`unstoppable`.

### Example: `finally`

In the following example, some asynchronous work must temporarily break a
program invariant. It uses `unstoppable` and `finally` to restore the
invariant.

```c++
  namespace ex = std::execution;

  ex::sender auto break_invariants(auto&... values);
  ex::sender auto restore_invariants(auto&... values);

  // This function returns a sender adaptor closure object. When applied to
  // a sender, it returns a new sender that breaks program invariants,
  // munges the data, and restores the invariants.
  auto safely_munge_data( ) {
    return ex::let_value( [](auto&... values) {
        return break_invariants(values...)
          | ex::then(do_munge) // the invariants will be restored even if `do_munge` throws
          | ex::finally(ex::unstoppable(restore_invariants(values...)));
    } );
  }

  auto sndr = ...;
  scope.spawn( sndr | safely_munge_data() ); // See `counting_scope` from P3149R2
```

Discussion
==========

There are a number of design considerations for the `finally` algorithm. The
following questions have been brought up during LEWG design review:

Should `finally` apply `unstoppable` by default to its second argument?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The observation was made that, since `finally` will often be used to do some
cleanup operation or to restore an invariant, that operation should not respond
to external stop requests, so `unstoppable` should be the default. It's a
reasonable suggestion. Of course, there would need to be a way to override the
default and allow the cleanup action to be canceled, and it isn't clear what
the syntax for that would be. Another adaptor called `stoppable_finally`?

It is worth noting that `unstoppable` has uses besides `finally`, so it
arguably should exist regardless of what the default behavior of `finally`
is. Given that `unstoppable` should exist anyway, and that its behavior is
pleasantly orthogonal to `finally`, the authors decided to keep them
separate and let users combine them how they like.

Is there a different design that better captures the "async RAII" intent?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Undoubtedly, the answer is "yes." There are probably several such designs.
One design that has been explored by Kirk Shoop is the so-called "async
object" ([@P2849R0]).

In Kirk's design, an async object has two basis operations: `async_construct`
and `async_destruct`, both of which are asynchronous; that is, they all
return senders. When `async_construct` completes, it does so with a handle to the
object. The handle lets you interact with the object. Calling `async_destruct`
on the object ends its lifetime.

A stop source, a run loop, and an async scope like [@P3149R2]'s `counting_scope`
can all be given the async object treatment. Multiple such async resources can
be used in tandem, as in the following example:

```c++
namespace ex = std::execution;

// In this example, stop_source_object, run_loop_object, and counting_scope_object
// all satisfy the async_object concept.
stop_source_object stop;
run_loop_object loop;
counting_scope_object scope;

auto thread_fn = [](auto stop, auto loop, auto scope) {
  // `thread_fn` must return a sender that uses the handles passed in.
  packaged_async_object thread{thread_object{}, [loop]{ loop.run(); }};

  auto work_fn = [=](auto /*thread*/) {
    // construct a stop callback that requests top on the run_loop when
    // stop is requested on the stop_source_object.
    auto stop_callback = []<class Token, class Fn>(Token tok, Fn fn) {
      return stop_callback_of_t<Token, Fn>{tok, fn};
    }(stop.get_token(), [loop] { loop.request_stop(); });

    // spawn 1000 tasks on the run_loop in the counting_scope.
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
      auto work = ex::then(ex::just(), [=]{ do_work(i);});
      ex::spawn(ex::on(loop.get_scheduler(), std::move(work)), scope);
    }

    // Tell the run_loop to stop when it has finished processing the work:
    scope_guard guard{[]{loop.request_stop()}};
    return ex::just();
  };

  return async_using(work_fn, thread);
};

// This sender, when connected and started, will async-construct the
// async objects, passes them as arguments to the thread_fn, start
// the returned sender, and when it completes, async-destruct the
// async objects in the reverse order of their construction:
ex::sender auto use = async_using(thread_fn, stop, loop, scope);

// Launch it all and wait for it to complete:
std::this_thread::sync_wait(std::move(use));
```

This design nicely captures the "async RAII" pattern. A type modeling the async
object concept is like an async class with an async constructor and an async
destructor. Instead of using `finally`, a user can implement a type that
satisfies the `async_object` concept.

Although there are times when it is appropriate to model the `async_object`
concept as presented in [@P2849R0], doing so is certainly more work than just
using `finally`. One can think of `finally` as an *ad hoc* form of async RAII.
To draw an analogy, `finally` is to `async_object` what `scope_guard` is to
custom RAII wrappers like `unique_ptr`. That is no diss on `scope_guard`; it has
its place!

So too does `finally` in the authors' opinion. It captures a common pattern
quite simply, and is not a far departure from what is in [exec] already. An
async object abstraction is a much heavier lift from a standardization
point of view. Pursuing that design instead of `finally` risks missing the
C++26 boat, leaving users without a standard way to reliably clean up
asynchronous resources.

In the end, the authors expect that we will have both, just as many codebases
make use of both `scope_guard` and `unique_ptr`.

Proposed Wording

[Replace all instances of "*`write-env`*" with "`write_env`". After
[exec.adapt.objects], add a new subsection "`execution::write_env`
[exec.write.env]" and move the specification of the exposition-only

2. Let <i>`write-env-t`</i> be an exposition-only empty class type.

3. *Returns:* ```@*make-sender*@(@*make-env-t*@(), std::forward<Env>(env), std::forward<Sndr>(sndr))```.

:::

2. `write_env` is a customization point object. For some subexpressions `sndr`
    and `env`, if `decltype((sndr))` does not satisfy `sender` or if
    `decltype((env))` does not satisfy _`queryable`_, the expression
    `write_env(sndr, env)` is ill-formed. Otherwise, it is expression-equivalent
    to <code><i>make-sender</i>(write_env, env, sndr)</code>.

3. [*Remarks:*]{.rm} The exposition-only class template *`impls-for`*
    ([exec.snd.general]) is specialized for

:::


[Change subsection "`execution::schedule_from` [exec.schedule.from]" to
"`execution::finally` [exec.finally]", change every instance of
"`schedule_from`" to "`finally`" and "`schedule_from_t`" to
"```@*decayed-typeof*@<finally>```", and change the subsection as follows:]{.ednote}

<font size="+1">[34.9.11.5]{.pnum}</font> **`execution::finally` [exec.finally]**

[Replace paragraphs 1-3 with the following:]{.ednote}

::: add

1. `finally` is a sender adaptor that starts one sender unconditionally after
    another sender completes. If the second sender completes successfully, the
    `finally` sender completes with the async results of the first sender.
    If the second sender completes with error or stopped, the async results
    of the first sender are discarded, and the `finally` sender completes
    with the async results of the second sender. <span class="note">It is
    similar in spirit to the `try`/`finally` control structure of some
    languages.</span>

2. The name `finally` denotes a customization point object. For some
    subexpressions `try_sndr` and `finally_sndr`, if `try_sndr` or
    `finally_sndr` do not satisfy `sender`, the expression
    `finally(try_sndr, finally_sndr)` is ill-formed.
    
3. Otherwise, the expression `finally(try_sndr, finally_sndr)` is
    expression-equivalent to
    ```@*make-sender*@(finally, {}, try_sndr, finally_sndr)```.

4. Let `CS` be a specialization of `completion_signatures` whose template
    parameters are the pack `Sigs`. Let ```@*VALID-FINALLY*@(CS)```
    be `true` if and only if there is no type in `Sigs` of the form
    `set_value_t(Ts...)` for which `sizeof...(Ts)` is greater than `0`. Let `F`
    be `decltype((finally_sndr))`. If `sender_in<F>` is `true` and
    ```@*VALID-FINALLY*@(completion_signatures_of_t<F>)``` is
    `false`, the program is ill-formed.

:::

5. The exposition-only class template *`impls-for`* ([exec.snd.general]) is
    specialized for `finally` as follows:

    ```
    namespace std::execution {

[Remove paragraph 5, which is about the requirements on customizations
of the algorithm; `finally` cannot be customized.]{.ednote}

[Insert a new subsection "`execution::schedule_from` [exec.schedule.from]" as
follows:]{.ednote}

<font size="+1">[34.9.11.?]{.pnum}</font> **`execution::schedule_from` [exec.schedule.from]**

[These three paragraphs are taken unchanged from [exec].]{.ednote}

1. `schedule_from` schedules work dependent on the completion of a sender onto a
    scheduler's associated execution resource. [`schedule_from` is not meant to
    be used in user code; it is used in the implementation of
    `continue_on`.]{.note}

2. The name `schedule_from` denotes a customization point object. For some
    subexpressions `sch` and `sndr`, let `Sch` be `decltype((sch))` and `Sndr` be
    `decltype((sndr))`. If `Sch` does not satisfy `scheduler`, or `Sndr` does not
    satisfy `sender`, `schedule_from` is ill-formed.

3. Otherwise, the expression `schedule_from(sch, sndr)` is expression-equivalent
    to:

    ```
    transform_sender(
      @*query-or-default*@(get_domain, sch, default_domain()),
      @*make-sender*@(schedule_from, sch, sndr));
    ```

    except that `sch` is evaluated only once.

::: add

4. The exposition-only class template *`impls-for`* is specialized
    for `schedule_from_t` as follows:

    ```
    template<>
    struct @*impls-for*@<schedule_from_t> : @*default-impls*@ {
      static constexpr auto @*get-attrs*@ =
        [](const auto& data, const auto& child) noexcept -> decltype(auto) {
          return @*JOIN-ENV*@(@*SCHED-ATTRS*@(data), @*FWD-ENV*@(get_env(child)));
        };
    };
    ```

5. Let `sndr` and `env` be subexpressions and let `Sndr` be
    `decltype((sndr))`. If ```@*sender-for*@<Sndr, schedule_from_t>``` is
    `false`, then the expression `schedule_from.transform_sender(sndr, env)` is
    ill-formed; otherwise, it is equal to:

    ```
    auto&& [tag, sch, child] = sndr;
    return finally(std::forward_like<Sndr>(child),
                   unstoppable(schedule(std::forward_like<Sndr>(sch))));
    ```

    [This causes the `schedule_from(sch, sndr)` sender to become `finally(sndr,
    unstoppable(schedule(sch)))` when it is connected to a receiver with an
    execution domain that does not customize `schedule_from`.]{.note}

:::

[The following paragraph is taken unchanged from [exec].]{.ednote}

6. Let `out_sndr` be a subexpression denoting a sender returned from
    `schedule_from(sch, sndr)` or one equal to such, and let `OutSndr` be the type
    `decltype((out_sndr))`. Let `out_rcvr` be a subexpression denoting a
    receiver that has an environment of type `Env` such that `sender_in<OutSndr,
    Env>` is `true`. Let `op` be an lvalue referring to the operation state that
    results from connecting `out_sndr` with `out_rcvr`. Calling `start(op)`
    shall start `sndr` on the current execution agent and execute completion
    operations on `out_rcvr` on an execution agent of the execution resource
    associated with `sch`. If scheduling onto `sch` fails, an error completion
    on `out_rcvr` shall be executed on an unspecified execution agent.

[The following changes to the `let_*` algorithms are not
strictly necessary; they are simplifications made possible by the addition of
the `write_env` adaptor above.]{.ednote}

[Remove [exec.let]p5.1, which defines an exposition-only class
*`receiver2`*.]{.ednote}

[Change [exec.let]p5.2.2 as follows:]{.ednote}

2. Given a type `Tag` and a pack `Args`, let *`as-sndr2`* be an alias template such that
   ```@*as-sndr2*@<Tag(Args...)>``` denotes the type
   ```@@[`@*call-result-t*@<@*decayed-typeof*@<write_env>,`]{.add}@@ @*call-result-t*@<Fn, decay_t<Args>&...>@[`, Env>`]{.add}@```. Then
   `ops2_variant_t` denotes the type
   ```variant<monostate, connect_result_t<@*as-sndr2*@<LetSigs>, @[<em>receiver2</em>&lt;]{.rm}@Rcvr@[, Env>]{.rm}@>...>```.

[Change [exec.let]p5.3 as follows:]{.ednote}

3. The exposition-only function template *`let-bind`* has effects equivalent to:

    ```
    using args_t = @_`decayed-tuple`_@<Args...>;
    auto mkop2 = [&] {
      return connect(
        @[`write_env(`]{.add}@
          apply(std::move(state.fn),
                state.args.template emplace<args_t>(std::forward<Args>(args)...)),
          @[`std::move(state.env)),`]{.add}@
        @@[`@_receiver2_@{rcvr, std::move(state.env)}`]{.rm}[`std::move(rcvr)`]{.add}@@);
    };
    start(state.ops2.template emplace<decltype(mkop2())>(@_`emplace-from`_@{mkop2}));
    ```
